# App description #
This music player is highly inspired by [Folder Music Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suphi.foldermusicplayerunlocker) by Suphi (free version no longer available on the Play Store), which lacked a few essential features to become perfect. _Gnarly Music Player_ is an attempt to fill those gaps and create a modern directory-based music player.

This core functionality the same as in _Folder Music Player_, but there are also many useful tools to efficiently navigate music library and manage playback queue. Visually the app is clean and simplistic, without excessive gradients, margins and animations.

Obviously this app is far from perfect. Code is messy, some functionality is missing, and there are some bugs. This is a hobby project after all. But the ideas behind the UI are pretty solid and the player has proved to be very convenient to use (at least for its creator).
