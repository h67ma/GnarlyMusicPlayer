# Changelog #

See [release notes](https://github.com/szycikm/GnarlyMusicPlayer/releases) for each release.

Version names are : `major.minor.patch`, e.g. `1.2.3`. Debug builds have a `-debug` at the end, so for example `1.2.3-debug`. Releases with increased `minor` number usually contain new features. Releases with bumped up `patch` number are usually bugfixes or optimizations. Also I usually throw in a `-pre` when it's a pre-release/work in progress.

# App description #
This music player is highly inspired by [Folder Music Player](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suphi.foldermusicplayerunlocker) by Suphi (free version no longer available on Play Store). It lacked a few essential (in my opinion) features to become perfect. I used it for a few years, because I couldn't find any better app. I don't like library-based music players, and the ones based on folder structure were... not sufficient. Finally I decided to make my own music player.

This app is basically a mix of features that I want to see in a music player app, with the core functionality the same as in _Folder Music Player_. Part of philosophy behind that app was something like "simple but functional", and I tried to follow it.

Obviously this app is far from perfect. Code is messy, some functionality is missing, etc. What *is* perfect though, is the ideas behind UI, which, in my opinion, can't get much better.

I think the most important thing is that I'm actually using the app daily (since 1.0).
